# Systems Thinking - an Introduction

What is Systems Thinking and why is it also important for Software Development?

## The water cycle

Remember the last time you saw flooding in TV or real live? Why is there suddenly so much water that it takes away cars, homes and apparently lives?

Often it cannot be tracked back to a single event. It is the **interaction of elements**.  

- Rivers get less space to transport water way  
- City is full of concrete that does not absorb water
- Sun heats up concrete
<!-- more -->
- Concrete releases heat into the air at night
- Hot air rises and is condensing, leading to more moisture in the Air
- Once it starts raining the water cannot be absorbed nor transported away fast enough leading to flooding  

This is a **nonlinear system**. Systems Thinking is Nonlinear.

## What is a linear System?

A server costs you say 10 EUR / day. If you add another that's 20 EUR / day. There is a **disconnection between the elements**.

## Is Software Development linear or nonlinear?

Let's learn Python, it has 35 keywords. Once you know each of them you know Python right? Wrong.  

You can however learn Python with a linear approach.  

1. Learn the def keyword  
2. Learn the built-In function print  
3. Write a hello world program  
4. Learn a new def keyword and start again

To further learn and better benefit from the language soon you need to structure the program you write.  

When building a web shop you don't want to write every functionality on your own.  

You use already developed parts and need to learn how to connect them.  
What are their **Relationships**.  
How do they interact?  
You create a new **Whole**.  
A mistake sneaks into the system. You start analyzing.  
There might be timing involved.  
You have assumptions.

You debug the program. You analyse the **elements** and their **Relationships**. You need to understand the **Whole**.

You apply Systems Thinking.  

Software Development is often a combination of linear and nonlinear thinking. A change in one part of the System can influence the whole System in unpredictable ways.

## Exercice for you

You plant 3 chili seeds.  
How much plants will you get?  
Is this a linera or a non linear system?

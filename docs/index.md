# Why this page?

## The medium is the message

I choose to not use the latest fancy javascript framework. Instead something that works, is here to stay, so i can focus on content.

## What i choose

[material for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

on the offical page there is this excellent [manual](https://jameswillett.dev/getting-started-with-material-for-mkdocs) linked also containing a Video.

## What i considered but not choose

[quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) because it has obsidian support

[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)

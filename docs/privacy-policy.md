## Relevant legal bases {#m2427}

**Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:** In the following, you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.

*   **Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)** - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.
*   **Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)** - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
*   **Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)** - the processing is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, do not prevail.

**National data protection regulations in Germany:** In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations apply to data protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.

**Reference to the applicability of the GDPR and the Swiss DPA:** These privacy policy serves both to provide information pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms used in the GDPR are applied. In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss FADP such as "processing" of "personal data", "predominant interest", and "particularly sensitive personal data", the terms used in the GDPR, namely "processing" of "personal data", as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" are used. However, the legal meaning of these terms will continue to be determined according to the Swiss FADP within its scope of application.

## Security Precautions {#m27}

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.

Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect the data of users transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we employ TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information that is transferred between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby safeguarding the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions conform to the highest security standards. When a website is secured with an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being securely and encryptedly transmitted.

## Transmission of Personal Data {#m25}

In the course of processing personal data, it may happen that this data is transmitted to or disclosed to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals. Recipients of this data may include service providers tasked with IT duties or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and particularly conclude relevant contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.

## International data transfers {#m24}

Data Processing in Third Countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)), or if the processing is done within the context of using third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other individuals, entities, or companies, this is only done in accordance with legal requirements. If the data protection level in the third country has been recognized by an adequacy decision (Article 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers only occur if the data protection level is otherwise ensured, especially through standard contractual clauses (Article 46 (2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or in cases of contractual or legally required transfers (Article 49 (1) GDPR). Furthermore, we provide you with the basis of third-country transfers from individual third-country providers, with adequacy decisions primarily serving as the foundation. "Information regarding third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be obtained from the information provided by the EU Commission: [https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection\_en.](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en) Within the context of the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the data protection level for certain companies from the USA as secure within the adequacy decision of 10th July 2023. The list of certified companies as well as additional information about the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/.](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/) We will inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework as part of our data protection notices.

## General Information on Data Retention and Deletion {#m12}

We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal regulations as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no further legal bases for processing exist. This applies to cases where the original purpose of processing is no longer applicable or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if statutory obligations or special interests require a longer retention or archiving of the data.

In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons, or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons, must be archived accordingly.

Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data specifically applicable to certain processing processes.

In cases where multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines for a date are specified, the longest period always prevails.

If a period does not expressly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the time at which the termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.

Data that is no longer stored for its originally intended purpose but due to legal requirements or other reasons are processed exclusively for the reasons justifying their retention.

**Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:**

*   **Data Retention and Deletion:** The following general deadlines apply for the retention and archiving according to German law:
    *   10 Years - Fiscal Code/Commercial Code - Retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balance sheet as well as the necessary work instructions and other organisational documents, booking receipts and invoices (Section 147 Paragraph 3 in conjunction with Paragraph 1 No. 1, 4 and 4a of the German General Tax Code (AO), Section 14b Paragraph 1 of the German VAT Act (UStG), Section 257 Paragraph 1 Numbers 1 and 4, Paragraph 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB)).

    *   3 Years - Data required to consider potential warranty and compensation claims or similar contractual claims and rights, as well as to process related inquiries, based on previous business experiences and common industry practices, will be stored for the duration of the regular statutory limitation period of three years. This period begins at the end of the year in which the relevant contractual transaction took place or the contractual relationship ended in the case of ongoing contracts (Sections 195, 199 of the German Civil Code).

## Plugins and embedded functions and content {#m328}

Within our online services, we integrate functional and content elements that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may, for example, be graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "Content").

The integration always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of these contents or functions. We strive to use only those contents, whose respective offerers use the IP address only for the distribution of the contents. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit times and other information about the use of our website, as well as may be linked to such information from other sources.

*   **Processed data types:** Usage data (e.g. page views and duration of visit, click paths, intensity and frequency of use, types of devices and operating systems used, interactions with content and features). Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, timestamps, identification numbers, involved parties).
*   **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
*   **Purposes of processing:** Provision of our online services and usability.
*   **Retention and deletion:** Deletion in accordance with the information provided in the section "General Information on Data Retention and Deletion". Storage of cookies for up to 2 years (Unless otherwise stated, cookies and similar storage methods may be stored on users' devices for a period of two years.).
*   **Legal Basis:** Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

**Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:**

*   **Google Fonts (from Google Server):** Obtaining fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of a technically secure, maintenance-free and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to timeliness and loading times, their uniform presentation and consideration of possible restrictions under licensing law. The provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are transmitted which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. This data may be processed on a server of the provider of the fonts in the USA - When visiting our online services, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API. The Google Fonts Web API provides users with Google Fonts' cascading style sheets (CSS) and then with the fonts specified in the CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by each user to access the Internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent describing the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referral URL (i.e., the web page where the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are not logged or stored on Google servers and they are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referring URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must match the font that is generated for the particular browser type. The user agent is logged primarily for debugging purposes and is used to generate aggregate usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregate usage statistics are published on Google Fonts' Analytics page. Finally, the referral URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and to generate an aggregate report on top integrations based on the number of font requests. Google says it does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to profile end users or serve targeted ads; **Service provider**: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; **Legal Basis:** Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR); **Website:** [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/); **Privacy Policy:** [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy); **Basis for third-country transfers:** Data Privacy Framework (DPF). **Further Information:** [https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en).
*   **OpenStreetMap:** We integrate the maps from the "OpenStreetMap" service, which are provided based on the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF). OpenStreetMap uses user data exclusively for the purpose of displaying map functions and caching the selected settings. This data may particularly include the IP addresses and location data of the users, which, however, are not collected without their consent (typically within the settings of their devices or browsers); **Service provider**: OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF); **Legal Basis:** Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR); **Website:** [https://www.openstreetmap.de](https://www.openstreetmap.de); **Terms & Conditions:** [https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy\_Policy](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy). **Privacy Policy:** [https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy\_Policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy).

## Management, Organization and Utilities {#m723}

We use services, platforms and software from other providers (hereinafter referred to as " third-party providers") for the purposes of organizing, administering, planning and providing our services. When selecting third-party providers and their services, we comply with the legal requirements.

Within this context, personal data may be processed and stored on the servers of third-party providers. This may include various data that we process in accordance with this privacy policy. This data may include in particular master data and contact data of users, data on processes, contracts, other processes and their contents.

## Terminology and Definitions {#m42}

In this section, you will find an overview of the terminology used in this privacy policy. Where the terminology is legally defined, their legal definitions apply. The following explanations, however, are primarily intended to aid understanding.

*   **Contact data:** Contact details are essential information that enables communication with individuals or organizations. They include, among others, phone numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses, as well as means of communication like social media handles and instant messaging identifiers.
*   **Content data:** Content data comprise information generated in the process of creating, editing, and publishing content of all types. This category of data may include texts, images, videos, audio files, and other multimedia content published across various platforms and media. Content data are not limited to the content itself but also include metadata providing information about the content, such as tags, descriptions, authorship details, and publication dates.

These data may include, among others, personal and demographic details such as names, contact information (addresses, phone numbers, email addresses), birth dates, and specific identifiers (user IDs). Inventory data form the foundation for any formal interaction between individuals and services, facilities, or systems, by enabling unique assignment and communication.
*   **Log data:** Protocol data, or log data, refer to information regarding events or activities that have been logged within a system or network. These data typically include details such as timestamps, IP addresses, user actions, error messages, and other specifics about the usage or operation of a system. Protocol data is often used for analyzing system issues, monitoring security, or generating performance reports.
*   **Meta, communication and process data:** Meta-, communication, and procedural data are categories that contain information about how data is processed, transmitted, and managed. Meta-data, also known as data about data, include information that describes the context, origin, and structure of other data. They can include details about file size, creation date, the author of a document, and modification histories. Communication data capture the exchange of information between users across various channels, such as email traffic, call logs, messages in social networks, and chat histories, including the involved parties, timestamps, and transmission paths. Procedural data describe the processes and operations within systems or organisations, including workflow documentations, logs of transactions and activities, and audit logs used for tracking and verifying procedures.
*   **Personal Data:** "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
*   **Processing:** The term "processing" covers a wide range and practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure.
*   **Usage data:** Usage data refer to information that captures how users interact with digital products, services, or platforms. These data encompass a wide range of information that demonstrates how users utilise applications, which features they prefer, how long they spend on specific pages, and through what paths they navigate an application. Usage data can also include the frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP addresses, device information, and location data. They are particularly valuable for analysing user behaviour, optimising user experiences, personalising content, and improving products or services. Furthermore, usage data play a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and potential problem areas within digital offerings
